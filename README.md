# Practice Using Docker

From Udemy course [Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/),
this repo covers sections 4 to 7 (if I'm not mistaken, still re-working the material).

I originally worked on these lectures 4 years ago but am wanting to refresh my memory 
on this material.
